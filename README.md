# Backend Developer Test

## General 💬

Greetings brave soul! We are excited you are here 🙂 This test will be one which tests your general knowledge around key technologies we use at Asset Panda as well as your ability to adapt to the current codebase. It is recommended that you time box this exercise to 4 - 6 hours, if it takes you longer than that you will probably hate working on this project.

## Tech 💻

### Mono Repo

This workspace was generated with [NX](https://nx.dev/).

#### Clue 🔎

You will need NX's [run command](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/run) to execute the api server's serve and test processes found in the `./packages` dir.

### System Dependencies ⬇

- Node ~v18.17.1
- NPM ~9.6.7

## Todo ⚠️

### Test Work

#### Complete as many of the following as you can in order

1. There some bugs, find and fix them. All tests should pass (⚠️ !!DO NOT EDIT THE TESTS!! ⚠️)
2. Create a new end point which serves data with jest testing
3. This code is kinda 💩, refactor it using best practices
4. Leave inline todos and questions which you think should be done to further improve the setup

#### Bonus Points

1. Modify the api the be AWS Lambda friendly
2. Deploy it to a live API Gateway and include that working endpoint's address on this document

### Delivery

1. Remove the node_modules and andy git directories
2. Zip up and return this project
