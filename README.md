# Backend Test

## General

Greetings brave soul! We are excited you are here ðŸ™‚Â This test will be one which tests your general knowledge around key technologies we use at Asset Panda as well as your ability to adapt to the current codebase. It is recommended that you time box this exercise to 4 hours, if it takes you longer than that you will probably hate working on this project.

## Tech

### Mono Repo

This workspace was generated with [NX](https://nx.dev/).

#### Clue ðŸ”Ž

You will need NX's [run command](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/run) to execute the api server's serve and test processes found in the `./packages` dir.

### System Dependencies

- Node ~v18.17.1
- NPM ~9.6.7

## Todo

- Refactor this code to be less confusing following best practices
- There are a couple bugs, find and fix them
- Create a new end point which serves data with jest testing
